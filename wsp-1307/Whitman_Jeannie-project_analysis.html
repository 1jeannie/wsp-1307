		<h1> Client: Scenic Boat Tours </h1>
		<h1> Project: Website Redesign </h1>
		<h1> Designer: Jeannie Whitman </h1>
		<h1> Document: Project Analysis </h1>
			<h2> Site Intent </h2>
				<p> This site currently consists of a landing page with a link to the single page site.
					The information is unorganized, with minimal styling. While the site provides the information
					most consumers would expect to find, it offers little reason for the consumer to either stay longer
					or return in the future. </p>
				<p> The clients intent for the redesign is to have a more professional site that includes increased content,
					user friendly interactivity, multi device responsiveness, and search engine optimization in order to increase
					the clients market share in both the local and visiting tourism markets. </p>
				<p> In order to meet the clients expectations, I will completely redesign the site. This will be accomplished by
					eliminating the landing page, replacing it with a home page and navigation to additional pages to house new
					and existing content.  Using appropriate html and css coding to provide for responsiveness, and recommendations
					for SEO. The clients current logo will be maintained.

					become interested in photography and is seeking opportunities to hone his skills.  Since he no longer drives,
