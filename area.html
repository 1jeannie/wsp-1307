		<h1> Welcome to Downtown Winter Park </h1>
			<p> Bordered by a central park that plays host to concerts and art festivals,
				Park Avenue is home to one-of-a-kind boutiques and well-known shops,
				sidewalk cafes and fine restaurants, as well as world renowned art
				collections in the area museums. </p>
			<p> Downtown Winter Park's charm is magnified in truly unique details:
				hidden gardens and side streets that are home to unique stores, a
				Farmers' Market that attracts locals and visitors alike each Saturday
				morning, festive parades that mark the season and the Scenic Boat Tour
				that cruises the canals between the city's lakes overlooking the area's
				most historic and prestigious homes.  Often called "Little Europe", Park
				Avenue in downtown Winter Park is a year-round destination that is sure
				to charm visitors of all ages. </p>
